//// The For Condition Increment

//// Const and Var declared in initialization only live in the loop

//// The While Loop

//// The If Statement

//// The If Else statement

//// prints "It's not that cold. Wear a t-shirt."

//// Chaining If Else statements

//// A Switch Statement

    print("\(someCharacter) is a consonant")
default:

//// prints "e is a vowel"


//// Range Matching
